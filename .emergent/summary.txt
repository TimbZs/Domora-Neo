The AI engineer successfully initiated the Domora marketplace application development, handling initial setup, API key collection, and core backend/frontend scaffolding. A significant portion of the trajectory involved troubleshooting and fixing authentication issues, which initially seemed like code bugs but were eventually traced to environment and infrastructure problems (Expo preview, file watcher limits). The AI demonstrated tenacity in debugging, using backend curl tests to isolate frontend issues and systematically applying fixes for API pathing, cross-platform storage ( vs ), and route configuration. A major turning point was when the user explicitly requested *every single page* to be created, which the AI then diligently implemented, laying out a comprehensive page structure. The current work is focused on expanding the user profile section.

<product_requirements>
Domora is a polished, production-ready marketplace web app for booking house cleaning, car washing & detailing, and landscaping across the EU (default timezone Europe/Ljubljana, currency EUR). It requires Customer, Provider, and Admin roles with secure authentication, role-based access, and GDPR-friendly data handling. Customers can discover services, configure packages/add-ons, enter geocoded addresses for instant price estimates (base + add-ons, travel fee beyond 15 km, 40 km radius cap), pick 30-minute slots from real-time provider availability, and pay via Stripe (authorize on booking, capture on completion, tips, refunds). Stripe Connect Express is for provider payouts. Provider onboarding includes profile, service areas, pricing overrides, availability, and a job board (accept/decline). Auto-assignment (Fastest match) is based on radius/slot, sorted by distance → rating → price, with reassignments. Features include in-app messaging, email notifications, ratings/reviews (1-5⭐, editable 24h). An Admin console is needed for catalog, booking oversight, refunds, provider verification, disputes, payouts, and an audit log. The app must be mobile-first, accessible (WCAG AA), fast, resilient (optimistic UI), and use a modern stack (Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind, Prisma + PostgreSQL, Resend, Mapbox/Google Maps). It needs tests, background jobs, rate limiting, migrations, seed data, , and a README. The user also explicitly requested that *every single page* be created, and the authentication process be fixed.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** Expo (mobile-first), Expo Router (file-based routing), React Native, React Context (authentication), SecureStore/localStorage (cross-platform storage), axios (HTTP client).
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), MongoDB (database), JWT (authentication), Google Maps API (geocoding, places), Stripe (payments), SMTP (email).
-   **General:** Role-Based Access Control, Environment Variables, API Integrations.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a monorepo structure with  and  directories.



-   :
    -   **Importance:** This is the core FastAPI backend application. It defines all API endpoints, database interactions with MongoDB, authentication logic (user registration, login, JWT handling), service catalog management, pricing calculations, and integration with external services like Stripe and Google Maps.
    -   **Changes Made:** Initial comprehensive implementation with user, service, booking, and payment models; authentication routes; price estimation logic; and integration stubs. Syntax errors and function call order issues were fixed to correctly use  and .
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Lists all Python dependencies required for the backend.
    -   **Changes Made:** Added To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]", , , , , , , ,  related packages, . Corrected installation issues with  and .
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Manages frontend dependencies for the Expo app.
    -   **Changes Made:** Updated  version, added , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  and several other specific versions for compatibility.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Defines the global navigation structure and layout for the Expo Router application, including handling authentication state and conditional rendering of routes (e.g., login vs. main tabs).
    -   **Changes Made:** Initially set up basic layout. Later, references to non-existent routes were removed to prevent warnings. It now dynamically renders tab navigation or auth screens based on user authentication status.
-   , , :
    -   **Importance:** These files represent the entry point and core authentication screens.  is the welcome/onboarding screen,  handles user sign-in, and  handles account creation.
    -   **Changes Made:** Initial UI setup for welcome, login, and registration forms. Debugging logs and  messages were added for better user feedback during authentication attempts.
-   :
    -   **Importance:** Provides React Context for authentication throughout the frontend. Manages user state, JWT tokens, and handles API calls for registration, login, and user data retrieval.
    -   **Changes Made:** Initial implementation for authentication logic. Crucially, the  was fixed to ensure correct API pathing (removing duplicate  prefixes) and environment-specific API URLs (local vs. deployed) were implemented. Cross-platform storage using  (native) and  (web) was implemented and bugs related to  were resolved. Detailed logging was added for debugging.
-    & :
    -   **Importance:** Store environment variables for frontend and backend configuration, respectively, including API keys and service URLs.
    -   **Changes Made:** Configured , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,  for the backend. Configured , , ,  for the frontend. The  was explicitly set to include  for local development.
-   **New Page Files (e.g., , , , , etc.):**
    -   **Importance:** These files represent all the different screens and functional areas of the application, ensuring no broken links.
    -   **Changes Made:** These files were created as empty or placeholder components to establish the complete route structure as requested by the user.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the remaining profile pages and integrate them into the profile navigation.
-   Conduct market research to define 10 service packages per category.
-   Implement personalized add-ons for each service.
-   Develop multi-cart functionality.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently focused on completing the user profile section. Several profile-related pages have been created, including:
-   : Likely for editing personal information.
-   : For managing user addresses.
-   : For managing payment methods.

The immediate next step is to create the *remaining* profile pages and then update the profile navigation within the application to link to these newly created pages, ensuring a complete and navigable user profile section.
